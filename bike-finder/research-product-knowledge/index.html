        <p>(1) I used this source to gain more information on the different material options when choosing a bike. It covered the four most common bike frames and discussed the benefits/disadvantages of each (and why certain people may gravitate towards one). It also discussed some of the important factors when deciding a bike (i.e. weight, context/use of bike, budget, etc.).</p>
        <p>(2) and (3) These sources specifically focused on the different genres of bikes and helped contextualise the different types of bikes people may choose. One surprise of these sources were the sheer number of bikes. Perviously I knew about road vs mountain bikes, but I had not heard of flat-foot comfort bikes, etc.</p>
        <p>(4) This source provided me with more information regarding the different components of bikes, including the ranges in quality and performance. Combined with the prior two sources, I now have a deeper understanding of all the different components that comprise a bike and are considered when buying a bike.</p>
        <p>(5) I used this source to learn the names of some specific bike brands. It discussed why they were popular and what they specialise in. </p>
        <p>(6) and (7) These source discussed biker demographics: who was more likely to bike, how biking culture varies across countries, bikes being used as transportation, and other helpful information. </p>
        <p>(8) This last source provided general information on how to go about buying a bike. It re-stated some of the points made in prior sources and gave me more insight for the different considerations. It also highlighted different bike accessories, such as helmets, and the importance of choosing your bike from a reputable source (i.e. advised against big-box stores).</p>
        <h1>Summary:</h1>
        <p>When purchasing a bike, a buyer will be faced with a lot of questions: what frame of bike do I want? what type of bike is best for me? what will I use my bike for? how often will I use my bike? where do I need my bike to be go/what terrain will it be subjected to? how much do I want to spend on my bike? what colour do I want my bike to be? what features do I want my bike to have? These are just a few of the big questions identified from the different sources, and my own experience looking for a bike. Buyers will have different priorities depending on what they plan to use the bike for. If they are using it for commuting, they may care more about its durability and ability to hold items such as a bag. If they are using it for road racing, they may prioritise its ability for speed and prefer a narrow frame over a more bulky one. If they are planning to use it in a wet/damp environment, they may prioritise the type of frame material of their bike over other features. Through this research, I came across a lot of new information. Previously I did not understand the sheer number of bikes that existed, or how they differed from one another. After reading through these sources, I have a better understanding of the different bikes. I understand now the pros/cons of the different bike frames (and why different bike frames may impact someone's choice). I understand better the complex nature of buying a bike; there are a lot of revolving components that go into purchasing a bike.</p>
