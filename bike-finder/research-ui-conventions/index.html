        <h1>Individual products</h1>
        <p>We investigated: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>(1) a floral, light blue iPhone 13 impact phone case (Casetify)</li>
                <li>(2) an 18oz Standard Mouth, Indigo water bottle (Hydroflask)</li>
                <li>(3) a digital talking, textured black weight scale (Taylor USA)</li>
                <li>(4) a lip balm sunscreen with sea moss and aloe stem cells (Sephora)</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>(1) floral, light blue iPhone 13 impact phone case</h2>
        <p>This product had the following UI elements:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>a dropdown feature for selecting the device type (designed to address problems of users having diferent phone dimensions)</li>
                <li>a single-select radio butten esque element for selecting the case type and colour (to address issues surrounding different user preferences)</li>
                <li>a query field at the top of the screen (to allow users to easily search other designs)</li>
                <li>a horizontally, scrollable photo album of the case on different phone colours (to allow users to visualise how their specific phone colour will look with the case)</li>
            </ul>
        <p>Before I interacted with each element, I did know how it would act due to convention and past experience with similar elements. Each element was successful, as they help the user determine the specific phone case variation and then if that variation will match their phone. One mistake I made was attempting to click on the review icon at the top of the page and expecting it to take me down to all the reviews (it did not). I was expecting it to do this due to past experience where this has worked. </p>
        <h2>(2) 18oz standard mouth, indigo water bottle</h2>
        <p>This product had the following UI elements:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>a single select, radio button esque colour selection (adressing the issues of different user colour preferences)</li>
                <li>a vertical, scrollable photo album of different angles of the bottles (allowing users to see it from all sides)</li>
                <li>a dropdown menu for the number of bottles a user wants to purchse (addresses the different quantities each user may want)</li>
                <li>a heart icon that once clicked adds it to your liked items</li>
                <li>a direct link between the review/filled-out star at the top of the page to the overall reviews/comments at the bottom of the page (allowed for users to quickly/easily find the reviews)</li>
            </ul>
        <p>I again knew how each element would act, due to convention.</p>
        <h2>(3) digital talking, textured black weight scale</h2>
        <p>This product had the following UI elements:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>an increase/decrease button that allowed you to indicate how many scales wanted (this was different to the water bottle which had a dropdown option with a max number)</li>
                <li>a horizontal scrolling photo album that had different angles of the scale (allowing the user to see what it looked like from differnt perspectives)</li>
                <li>a zoom in/zoom out feature that allowed the user to loonk more closely at the scale (this was a bit confusing, as it only zoomed in one more degree and zoomed out upon a second mouse press)</li>
                <li>a direct link between the star review icon at the top of the page to the reviews at the bottom</li>
                <li>a query field for the reviews, allowing a user to search up key words</li>
            </ul>
        <p>Aside from the zoom-in/out function, all other elements were familiar and acted how I expected them to/were successful.</p>
        <h2>(4) lip balm sunscreen with sea moss and aloe stem cells </h2>
        <p>This product had the following UI elements:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>a single select color option that could be formatted as either a grid or list (the list version seemed clunky and too larger for the screen)</li>
                <li>a single select option of delivery style (this allows users to indicate if they want it shipped, picked up, etc.)</li>
                <li>a vertical scrollable photo album of different sunscreen images</li>
                <li>a heart icon that could be clicked to add the product to your liked items</li>
                <li>a direct link between the star reviews at the top of the page and the reviews at the bottom</li>
                <li>a clickable "ask a question" link that scrolls the user down to a similar location as the star reviews link. This "ask a question" was a bit confusing, as it leads you to roughly the same location as the star reviews.</li>
                <li>links to key words that were highly rated by customers and, upon clicking the words, a curated list of reviews would appear on the screen</li>
            </ul>
        <p>Overall, the elements were easy to handle and as expected, the only slightly redundant one was the "ask a question" direct link.</p>
        <h1>Summary</h1>
        <p>Most of the stores/products shared the same elements. They all had a scrollable photo album (Sephora and Hydroflask was vertically situated while Taylor USA and Casetify was horizontally situated), a generic "add to basket/cart" button, a refernce to the reviews at the top of the page (although unlike the other three, Casetify did not have a clickable, direct link between the star reviews at the top of the page and the overall reviews at the bottom), and the option to select specific colours/styles of the product (mainly through a single select radio button esque element). </p>
        <p>Only a few things felt different, (1) Casetify not having clickable review stars, (2) the zoom feature of Taylor USA only zooming in one click, and (3) Sephora's ability to choose your preferred method of collecting the sunscreen (through a single select button option). </p>
        <p>Hydroflask was unique in having a dropdown element for indicating the number of bottles a user wanted to purchase. The only other store that also allowed this ability was Taylor USA, but they used an increase/decrease button with no apparant max limit. Hydroflask and Sephora were unique in having a heart/like button that could be pressed, adding the product to one's liked items. Sephora was also unqiue in its inclusion of highly rated key words that could be clicked to reveal past customer comments. Taylor USA was also unique in its clickable zoom in/out function.</p>
        <p>I think Hydroflask had a good combination of elements. It had a clean design that didn't appear too messy (unlike Sephora and the list option), the ability to move to reviews via clicking the star reviews at the top of the page (something Casetify could apply), a clickable heart icon (something Casetify and Taylor USA could apply), and the ability to select the quantity of wanted products (something Casetify and Sephora could apply).</p>
        <p>Overall I felt neutral when interacting with these sites, and I think this is due to my experience and past history interacting with online shopping stores. I have come across a lot of different pages and interfaces, so none of these sites greatly surprised me. I was happiest/most comfortable when the elements interacted as I expected them to. I also liked the sites that were more straightforward and appeared less cluttered (i.e. Hydroflask). I was disrupted/confused when something didn't work as anticipated (i.e. Casetify star review not being clickable and Taylor USA zoom function being one click).</p>
